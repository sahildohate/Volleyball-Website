    <center><u><i>Rules</i></u></center>
  </h1>
  <hr><br>
  <ol>
    <li> <B>Court dimensions:</B> A volleyball court is rectangular and measures 18 meters long and 9 meters wide. </i>
    </li>
    <li> <b>Net height:</b> The net is hung at the center of the court and stands 2.43 meters high for men and 2.24
      meters high for women. </li>
    <li> <b>Teams:</b> Each team consists of six players, with three in the front row and three in the back row. </li>
    <li><b>Scoring:</b> Points are scored when a team successfully hits the ball over the net and it lands on the other
      team's court, or when the opposing team makes a mistake. The first team to reach 25 points wins the set, and the
      first team to win three sets wins the match.</li>
    <li><b>Serve:</b> The game begins with a serve, where a player from the back row hits the ball over the net to the
      other team. The serve must go over the net and land in the opposing team's court.</li>
    <li><b>Rotation:</b> After each point is scored, the teams rotate clockwise, with the player in the back right
      position moving to the front right position to serve. </li>
    <li><b>Substitutions:</b> Teams are allowed an unlimited number of substitutions, but only when the player being
      substituted has left the court. </li>
    <Li><b>Faults:</b> Faults occur when a player touches the net during play, steps over the center line, or hits the
      ball outside the boundaries of the court. </Li>
    <li><b>Libero:</b> A libero is a specialized defensive player who wears a different color jersey and is allowed to
      replace any back-row player without counting as a substitution. </li>
    <li><b>Timeouts:</b> Each team is allowed two timeouts per set, and they last for one minute each.</li>
    <Li><b>Blocking:</b> Players in the front row can block the ball as it crosses the net into their own court. The
      block does not count as a touch, so the player who blocked the ball can still make the next touch. </Li>
    <li><b>Rally scoring:</b> In rally scoring, a point is awarded on every play, regardless of which team served. This
      means that a team can score a point even if they didn't serve the ball. </li>
    <li><b>Antennae:</b> The net is divided into two halves by a vertical antenna on either side of the court. The ball
      must pass between the antennas in order to be considered in bounds. </li>
    <Li><b>Service order:</b> The order in which players serve is determined at the beginning of the game and follows a
      rotational order throughout the match. </Li>
    <li><b>Service order:</b> Foot faults: Players are not allowed to step on or over the end line during a serve, or
      they will be called for a foot fault.</Li>
    <li><b>Double hit:</b> Players are not allowed to touch the ball twice in a row, unless it comes off the block. This
      means that a player cannot hit the ball, then hit it again before it goes over the net. </li>
    <li><b>Center line:</b> Players are not allowed to cross the center line during play, or they will be called for a
      fault. This rule is in place to prevent collisions between players from opposing teams.
    </li>
    <li><b>Service area: </b>The area from which the serve is made is called the service area, and players must stay
      behind the end line until after they have made contact with the ball.</li>
    <li> <b>Touches:</b> A team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball over the net. The ball must be touched
      by three different players or hit off the block before it crosses the net. </li>
    <Li><b>Let serve:</b> If the serve hits the net and lands in the opponent's court, it is called a let serve and is
      replayed. </Li>
    <li><b>Challenge system:</b> Some competitions use a challenge system where teams can challenge certain calls made
      by the referees. If the challenge is successful, the team keeps their challenge, but if it is unsuccessful, they
      lose their challenge. </li>
    <li><b>Red card:</b> In some competitions, a player or coach can be issued a red card for misconduct, such as
      arguing with the referees or using inappropriate language. A red card results in immediate expulsion from the
      game. </li>
    <li><b>Yellow card:</b> A yellow card is a warning given to a player or coach for minor misconduct, such as delaying
      the game or not following the rules. Two yellow cards result in a red card. </li>
    <Li><b>Overtime:</b> In some competitions, if the match is tied after the first three sets, an additional set may be
      played to determine the winner. This is often referred to as a "golden set" or "overtime."</Li>
    <Li><b>Time limit:</b> Matches usually have a time limit, typically two hours, so that they can fit into a
      tournament schedule. </Li>
    <li><b> Warm-up:</b> Before a match, teams usually have a warm-up period where they can practice their serves,
      passes, and hits. </li>
    <li><b>Referees:</b> Volleyball matches are officiated by two referees, one on each side of the net, who make calls
      on faults, touches, and other violations. </li>
    <li><b>Coin toss:</b> A coin toss is used to determine which team will serve first and which side of the court they
      will start on. </li>
    <li><b>International rules:</b> While most of the rules of volleyball are the same across the world, there are some
      differences in international rules, such as the number of substitutions allowed and the height of the net for
      men's and women's matches.</li>
