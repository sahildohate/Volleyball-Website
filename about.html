    <h7> Volleyball was invented in <b>1895 </b>by <a
        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=william+g.+morgan&oq=William+G.+Morgan&aqs=chrome.0.0i355i512j46i512j0i512l6.2322j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
        target="_blank"><b>William G. Morgan</b></a>, a physical education instructor in <b>Holyoke, Massachusetts, USA</b>.
      Morgan created the game as a less physically demanding alternative to basketball, which was popular at the time.

      Originally called "mintonette," the game was played with a net and a ball similar to a basketball. The objective
      was to hit the ball back and forth over the net without allowing it to touch the ground. The first official game
      of volleyball was played on <b>July 7</b>, 1896 at Springfield College in Massachusetts.

      Over time, the game of volleyball evolved and rules were established. In 1916, the first international volleyball
      game was played between the United States and Canada. In 1928, the International Volleyball Federation <a

        target="_blank"><b>(FIVB)</b></a> was founded, and the first World Championships were held in <b>1949</b> for men and

      target="_blank"><b>Olympic</b></a> sport for the first time in <b>1964</b> at the Tokyo Games. Beach volleyball, a variation of
      the sport played on sand, became an Olympic sport in 1996 at the Atlanta Games.

      Today, volleyball is played all over the world at all levels of competition, from recreational to professional.
      The FIVB governs the sport internationally, and there are also national and regional organizations that oversee
      volleyball in different parts of the world.

      <li> In the early years of volleyball, there were no official positions or rotations. Players could move anywhere
        on the court and take on any role they wanted.</li>
      <li>The name "volleyball" was adopted in <b>1896</b>, and the first official ball for the sport was designed in 1900.
      </li>
      <li>The first official rules of volleyball were established in<b> 1916</b> by the United States Volleyball Association<a

      <li> The first two-person beach volleyball tournament was held in 1948 in California, and the sport quickly grew
        in popularity in the following decades.</li>
      <li>Volleyball has been played at every Summer Olympics since 1964, with the exception of the <b>1968</b> games in Mexico
        City.</li>

      <li>The United States men's national volleyball team won gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, which helped to
        popularize the sport in the United States.</li>

      <li>The FIVB organizes several major international volleyball events, including the World Championships, the
        Volleyball Nations League, and the Olympic Games.</li>

      <li>In recent years, there have been efforts to make volleyball more inclusive and accessible to people with
        disabilities. Sitting volleyball, which is played by athletes with lower-limb impairments, was added to the
        Paralympic Games in <b>1980</b>.</li>
